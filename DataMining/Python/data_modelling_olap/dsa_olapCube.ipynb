    "# Agenda\n",
    "Analytical data modeling involves designing a data model that supports reporting and analytics. Analytics can be defined as the **the systematic computational analysis of data.** The chief aim of analytical data modeling is to interprete and communicate meaningful patterns extracted from a data set and apply them towards effective decision making. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important for analyst to shift his point of view from **transactional operations on data (i.e. in OLTP)** to **analytical operations on data (i.e. in OLAP).** Analytics and Reporting are performed on data models (i.e. ORM, Cube), which are constructed on top of (mostly) transactional datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we demonstrate how to prepare data for both ORM and Cube modeling. We describe a few OLAP operations that can be implemented on a Cube model. The content for the remainder of this guide is as follows.\n",
